This is the 2D graphics engine project that I implemented for a 2D graphics class.

Concepts involved in making the project: 
-geometric primitives
-scan conversion
-clipping
-transformations
-compositing
-texture sampling
-gradients
-antialiasing
-filtering
-parametric curves
-geometric stroking

The project is implemented in C/C++.

Partial code is available on my [github project page](https://github.com/sking8/2D-Graphics).
