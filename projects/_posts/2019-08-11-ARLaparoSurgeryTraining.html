<p>This is a research project I produced with students in our school and in University in Arizona.<br/>
The purpose of the project is to train laparoscopic surgery for medical students in an AR system.<br/>
    I created precise 3D models for laparoscopic instruments and generated several clips of animation to train neural network which enables tracking of the medical instruments.<br/>
    I also tried a method using auto encoder to track the pose of prism.</p>
