<p>This is a project that I developed in the summer of my junior year.<br/>
I made the 3D animation of patient and doctor interaction.<br/>
I also made realistic looking models for ultrasound machine and clothes for patient.<br/>
    Then the work was imported to Unity in order to add some interaction elements such as video controller and also 3D sound.</p>
