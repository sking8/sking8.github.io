I"k<p>This is a project that I developed in the summer of my junior year.<br />
I made the 3D animation of patient and doctor interaction.<br />
I also made realistic looking models for ultrasound machine and clothes for patient.<br />
    Then the work was imported to Unity in order to add some interaction elements such as video controller and also 3D sound.</p>
