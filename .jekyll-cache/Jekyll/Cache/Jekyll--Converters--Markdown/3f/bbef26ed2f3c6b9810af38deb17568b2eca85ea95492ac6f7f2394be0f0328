<p>This is a website that I created with four other teammates for Market Place Competition held by Red Ventures.
I was the one who initiated the team and formed team. 
I divided the tasks to different parts to teammates according to their specializations.
I also planned out and enforced the timeline in order to finish  the project within one-week time limit.</p>
