I" <p>This is the 2D graphics engine project that I developed for a 2D graphics class.
I enjoyed the class a lot, because I finally was able to take a class in computer graphics after completing all the other prerequisite.
This class helped me build a strong foundation in 2D graphics.
I learned the whole graphics pipeline from inputting vertex data, transformation using matrix, clipping edges to scan line conversion.
I did not use any graphics libraries through the whole project and built everything from scratch.
I really appreciate by the ability of coding to produce beautiful images with high performance.</p>

<p>Concepts involved in making the project: 
-geometric primitives
-scan conversion
-clipping
-transformations
-compositing
-texture sampling
-gradients
-antialiasing
-filtering
-parametric curves
-geometric stroking</p>

<p>The project is implemented in C/C++.</p>

<p>Partial code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/sking8/2D-Graphics">github project page</a>.</p>
